# Java Practice Projects üíª

These are simple Java programs I wrote to prepare for my Computer Science major at UMass Amherst. This repo will grow as I build more projects and learn more coding concepts.

## üóÇÔ∏è Programs Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `DealOrNoDeal.java` | I made a Java Swing ‚ÄúDeal or No Deal‚Äù game with 10 cases. Pick one to keep, open the others, and choose to take a deal based on the average of unopened cases. The game ends after 8 are opened or if you take the deal. Score = deal or your case's value. |
| `TicTacToe.java` | This Java program implements a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game where players take turns choosing cells on a 3x3 grid by entering numbers 1‚Äì9. The game tracks moves, checks for win conditions after each turn (rows, columns, or diagonals), and declares a winner or a draw when all moves are completed. The board updates dynamically, displaying "X" for Player 1 and "O" for Player 2. |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Programs

To run these Java programs on your computer:

1. Open a terminal or Git Bash
2. Navigate to the folder where the `.java` file is saved
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
