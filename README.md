# Java Practice Projects üíª

These are simple Java programs I wrote to prepare for my Computer Science major at UMass Amherst. This repo will grow as I build more projects and learn more coding concepts.

## üóÇÔ∏è Programs Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `HelloWorld.java` | Prints "Hello, world!" to the console ‚Äî the classic first program. |
| `Calculator.java` | A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using conditionals. |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Programs

To run these Java programs on your computer:

1. Open a terminal or Git Bash
2. Navigate to the folder where the `.java` file is saved
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
