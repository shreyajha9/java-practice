# Java Practice Projects üíª

These are simple Java programs I wrote to prepare for my Computer Science major at UMass Amherst. This repo will grow as I build more projects and learn more coding concepts.

## üóÇÔ∏è Programs Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `DealOrNoDeal.java` | I made a Java Swing ‚ÄúDeal or No Deal‚Äù game with 10 cases. Pick one to keep, open the others, and choose to take a deal based on the average of unopened cases. The game ends after 8 are opened or if you take the deal. Score = deal or your case's value. |
| `UsingDealOrNoDeal.java` | UsingDealOrNoDeal.java is the main UI file that launches the Deal or No Deal game. It sets up the game window (JFrame) and creates the interactive interface using JButton components. Each button represents one of the 10 briefcases. Players click buttons to open cases, track values, and receive deal offers. This file handles the visual layout and user interactions. |
| `TicTacToe.java` | This Java program implements a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game where players take turns choosing cells on a 3x3 grid by entering numbers 1‚Äì9. The game tracks moves, checks for win conditions after each turn (rows, columns, or diagonals), and declares a winner or a draw when all moves are completed. The board updates dynamically, displaying "X" for Player 1 and "O" for Player 2. |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Programs

To run these Java programs on your computer:

1. Open a terminal or Git Bash
2. Navigate to the folder where the `.java` file is saved
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
